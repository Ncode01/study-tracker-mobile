## 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

```
UI Interaction → Provider Method → Database Helper → SQLite Database
     ↓               ↓                    ↓               ↓
State Update ← notifyListeners() ← Database Response ← Data Persistence
```

### Example Flows
1. **Create Entry**: FAB → AddScreen → Provider.add() → DatabaseHelper.insert() → UI Refresh
2. **Toggle Complete**: Checkbox → Provider.toggle() → DatabaseHelper.update() → Visual Update  
3. **Delete Entry**: Swipe → Confirm → Provider.delete() → DatabaseHelper.delete() → List Refresh
4. **Edit Entry**: Tap → AddScreen(editing) → Provider.update() → DatabaseHelper.update() → UI Return

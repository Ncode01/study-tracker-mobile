## âœ… Confirmation Statement

**Step 1 is complete.** The 'Caveat' font and `assets/images/` directory have been added and declared in pubspec.yaml. New theme files `journey_map_colors.dart` and `journey_map_theme.dart` have been created with the specified colors and styles. The MaterialApp in app.dart has been updated to use `journeyMapTheme` as the default application theme. The application is now ready for **Step 2: the static UI build of the new JourneyMapScreen**.

All foundation elements are in place and the application will transform to the whimsical, hand-drawn "Journey Map" aesthetic once the font files are added and `flutter pub get` is executed.

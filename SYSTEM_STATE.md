## Current Implementation Status

| Module | Status | Last Updated | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Project Setup | Not Started | 2025-05-03 | Initial documentation created |
| Core Models | Not Started | 2025-05-03 | Pending implementation |
| UI Framework | Not Started | 2025-05-03 | Pending implementation |

| Data Storage | Not Started | 2025-05-03 | Pending implementation |
| State Management | Not Started | 2025-05-03 | Provider to be implemented |

## Design Decisions

### Architecture
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture selected for separation of concerns and testability
- Data models will be immutable to prevent state bugs
- UI components will be organized by feature rather than by type

### Technology Choices
- Provider for state management due to its simplicity and Flutter integration
- Hive for local storage for its performance and ease of use with Flutter
- Material Design 3 for UI with custom theming for student-friendly appearance

## Next Steps

1. Set up core project folders and structure
2. Implement basic theme configuration
3. Create data models for core entities
4. Develop tab-based navigation system
5. Design placeholder screens for main tabs

## Known Issues
